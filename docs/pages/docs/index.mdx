# Introduction to Flux

Flux is a modern, native macOS media center built with SwiftUI. It allows you to browse, manage, and play movies and TV shows with a premium "Glass" aesthetic.

## Why Flux?

-   **Native Experience**: Unlike Electron apps, Flux feels like it belongs on your Mac.
-   **Performance**: Built with Swift and MPV for buttery smooth playback of 4K HDR content.
-   **Privacy**: Open source and transparent. No tracking.
