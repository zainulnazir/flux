# Features

Flux is packed with powerful features designed for media enthusiasts.

## ⚡️ Native Performance
Built purely with SwiftUI, Flux takes advantage of the latest macOS technologies. Animations are smooth (120Hz ProMotion support), and memory usage is minimal compared to web-based players.

## 🎬 Universal Playback
Under the hood, Flux uses a custom build of **mpv**, the world's most powerful media engine. This means support for:
-   MKV, MP4, AVI, WEBM, and more.
-   HDR and Dolby Vision tone mapping.
-   Subtitle support (ASS, SRT, PGS).

## 🏎️ Flux Mode
Our signature feature. Search for a movie or show, and Flux automatically races multiple sources to find the fastest, highest-quality stream available. No buffering, just instant playback.

## 🧠 Smart Discovery
Powered by TMDB, Flux offers:
-   **Trending Lists**: See what's popular today.
-   **Search**: Find any movie or show instantly.
-   **For You**: AI-based recommendations based on your watch history.

## 🔒 Privacy Focused
Flux is open source. All data stays local or communicates directly with public APIs (TMDB). We do not track your usage.
